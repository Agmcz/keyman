# Keyman Keyboard Processor API

## Requirements
1. Cross platform.
2. Cross language.
3. Facilitate stateless operation of the Engine.
4. Keyboard format agnostic -- support both KMN and future LDML based keyboards.
5. Support querying Engine attributes.
6. Support querying Keyboard attributes.
7. Idempotent


## Glossary
- __Platform layer:__
the code that consumes the Keyman Keyboard Processor API, and provides the
operating system-specific handling of keystroke events and integration with
applications.
- __Client Application:__
the application that has the focus and receives text events from the Platform
layer.
- __Context:__ Text preceding the insertion point
- __Marker:__ Positional state that can be placed in the Context.
- __Keyboard:__ A set of rules for execution my an Engine
- __Option:__ A variable in a dynamic or static key value store.
- __Processor:__
The componennt that can parse, and execute a particular keyboard.
- __State:__ An object that hold internal state of the Processor for a given
insertion point
- __Action:__
A directive output by the processor detailing how the Platform layer should
transform the Client Application's text buffer.
- __(Keyboard) Event:__
A virtual key board event and modifier map recevied from the platform to be
processed with the state object for this Client application.


## Design decisions in support of requirements:
- Use C or C99 types and calling convention for the interface, it has the
  broadest language FFI support. [1,2]
- Have client (platform glue) code load keyboards, manage & pass state. [3,4,7]
- Provide query calls to return static attributes data for keyboards and
  engine [5,6]
- Provide get/set calls for client accessible keyboard state information [3,4]

### Open decisions:
Text encoding for passing string data:
- __UTF-8__
Fits in existing C style strings, good space for BMP characters, good for
interchange, but extra processing for per character access.
- __UTF-16__
Best space compromise for BMP characters, surrogates.
- __UTF-32__
Worst BMP space use, but no processing overhead for indexing, no
multibyte issues.
- __All of the above let the client specify__
Least attractive but we do have a fast UTF encoder/decoder available
from graphite.
- __Native C/C++ multibyte widechar support__
Used to have issues but might be worth investigation.

Naming style:
- __Underscore__: All_names_are_lower_case
- __Camelcase__: AllWordsAreCapitalised
- __Drooping Camelcase__: exceptTheFirst

UTF-16 has been picked as Windows Win32 uses UTF-16 for wide character strings
as does MacOS NString. For a naming style the Underscore sytle has been chosen
because it loosely matches the C/C++ stdlib conventions and is a common well
understood style.

## API
### Namespace
All calls, types and enums are prefixed with the namespace identifier `km_kbp_`
```c
*/
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define KM_KBP_LIB_CURRENT  0
#define KM_KBP_LIB_AGE      0
#define KM_KBP_LIB_REVISION 0

#if defined(__cplusplus)
extern "C"
{
#endif
// Basic types
//
typedef uint16_t    km_kbp_cp;  // code point
typedef uint32_t    km_kbp_usv; // Unicode Scalar Value
typedef uint16_t    km_kbp_virtual_key;


/*```
### Error Handling
Error handling and success failure notification are communicated through a
general mechanism similar to COMâ€™s `HRESULT` scheme. Any functions that can
fail will always return a status value and all results are returned via
outparams passed to the function.
```c
*/
typedef uint32_t km_kbp_status;
enum km_kbp_status_codes {
  KM_KBP_STATUS_OK = 0,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_NO_MEM = 1,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_IO_ERROR = 2,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT = 3,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_KEY_ERROR = 4,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_OS_ERROR = 0x80000000
};

/*
```
The final status code KM_KBP_STATUS_OS_ERROR is intended to allow encapsulating
a platform error code, the remaining 31 low bits are the error code returned by
the OS for case where the failure mode is platform specific. For HRESULT codes
this only permits failure codes to be passed.


### Context
The context is the text to the left of the insertion point (caret, cursor).
The context is constructed by the Platform layer, typically by interrogating the
Client Application.  The context will be updated by the engine for keystroke
events.  If the Platform layer code caches the context, the context should be
reset when a context state change is detected. Context state changes can occur
when the user uses the mouse to move the insertion point, uses cursor keys,
switches applications or input fields, or presses hotkeys such as Ctrl+N to
start a new document. The full set of context state change triggers is up to the
Platform layer.

Context can also contain positional Markers (also known as 'deadkeys' in kmn
keyboards), which are transitory state flags that are erased whenever a context
state change is detected. Markers are always controlled by the Engine.

Contexts are always owned by their state.  They maybe set to a list of
context_items or interrogated for their current list of context items.

### Options
A stateâ€™s default options are set from the keyboard at creation time and the
environment. The Platform layer is then is expected to apply any persisted
options it is maintaining.  Options are passed into and out of API functions as
simple C arrays of `km_kbp_option` terminated with a `KM_KBP_OPTIONS_END`
sentinal value. A state's options are exposed and manipulatable via the
`km_kbp_option_set` API. All options are string values.

During processing when the glue code finds a PERSIST action type it should call
identify_option_src on the state to find out which store the option comes from,
read the updated value from the stateâ€™s option list and store the updated option
in the appropriate place. For RESET it should do the same but the read the
current default and update the options set.
