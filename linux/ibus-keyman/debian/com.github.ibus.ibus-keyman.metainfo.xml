​  <description>
​    <p>
      This input method provides the Keyman IM engine for IBus. With this module, you can
      use keyboard layouts designed for Keyman version 11 or earlier under the IBus
      platform.

    <p>
      Originally created in 1993 to type Lao on Windows, Keyman is now a free and
      open source keyboarding platform which allows anyone to write a keyboard layout
      for their language. Keyman is available for many platforms, including Windows,
      macOS, iOS, Android, Linux and the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keyboard layouts are defined with a clear and easy to understand keyboard
      grammar. Keyman's contextual input model means keyboard layouts can be
      intelligent and make it simple to type even the most complex languages.
      Keyboard layouts are distributed through an open catalog to all major desktop
      and mobile platforms.
