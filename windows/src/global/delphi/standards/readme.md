# About the standards data files in this folder

The files in this folder are generated by `buildtools/build_standards_data` during the standard build process. They should 
not be included in the repo. `build_standards_data` itself uses the standards data files in `<keyman.git>/resources/standards-data/`.
See the readme.md in that folder for processes for updating the data files.
