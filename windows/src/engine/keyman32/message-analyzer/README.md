# Event tracing

keyman-debug-etw.man will be installed with Keyman Engine so that debug log files can be analyzed in Event Viewer or 
Microsoft Message Analyzer. You can import the layout file keyman-debug-etw.asset into Microsoft Message Analyzer 
to provide a good default layout for Keyman log files.

Debug log files are written to %LOCAL_APP_DATA%\Keyman\Diag.
